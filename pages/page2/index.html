            <p>Soshiro is the vice-captain of the Third Division of the Defense Force and a powerful combatant, capable of fighting on par with Kaiju No. 10. While his skill set puts him at a disadvantage against large-sized kaiju, Soshiro's proficiency in defeating small to mid-sized kaiju in battle surpasses that of the captain of the First Division, "Japan's Strongest Anti-Kaiju Combatant", Gen Narumi. His older brother and captain of the Sixth Division, Soichiro Hoshina, states that Soshiro stands above everyone in the Hoshina Family, past or present.</p>
